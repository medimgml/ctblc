The coexistence of pulmonary tuberculosis and lung cancer (CTBLC) shares highly similar CT imaging features with isolated lung cancer (ILC), posing significant diagnostic challenges and increasing the likelihood of misdiagnosis. Although CTBLC and ILC require distinct treatment approaches, studies employing machine learning to predict CTBLC remain limited. This study seeks to establish and validate a non-invasive combined model that integrates radiomics signatures to distinguish CTBLC from ILC based on CT imaging.
